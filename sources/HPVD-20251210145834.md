# HPVD

The **Hybrid Probabilistic Vector Database (HPVD)** is a new type of search engine designed for organizations that need **reliable, transparent, and safe** information retrieval.
Instead of returning documents using opaque and uncalibrated scores—as most search and RAG systems do—**HPVD adds a probabilistic layer that measures confidence, explains why each result was retrieved, and avoids showing results when it is unsure**.
HPVD is built to support enterprise search, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and regulatory environments such as **healthcare, finance, legaltech, and customer service**.

## **Why was HPVD created?**
Today’s search and RAG systems combine:
*   **Sparse retrieval** (keyword-based, BM25)
*   **Dense retrieval** (neural embeddings, ANN)
But they suffer from major issues:
### **1\. No calibration — scores can’t be trusted**
Sparse and dense scores are incompatible and often combined using arbitrary heuristics.
This means:
*   the system may appear confident when it shouldn’t
*   ranking may be unstable
*   errors can silently propagate into RAG/LLM pipelines
### **2\. No explainability**
Most vector databases behave like black boxes:
they cannot show _why_ a document appeared or _how sure_ the system was.
### **3\. No abstention**
Traditional search engines always return something—even when nothing is relevant.
In high-stakes environments, this is dangerous.
HPVD was built to solve these problems with a **probabilistic, transparent, and regulatory-ready retrieval engine**. Hybrid Probabilistic Vector Dat…

## **What does HPVD actually do?**
HPVD transforms retrieval from a heuristic process into a **confidence-aware, explainable, and auditable pipeline**.
### ✔ **Combines sparse and dense search—properly**
Instead of mixing BM25 and embeddings with arbitrary weights,
HPVD interprets their scores as **probability distributions**, then aligns them using calibration techniques like Bayesian fusion and isotonic regression.
### ✔ **Provides confidence levels for every retrieved document**
Each result comes with a probability such as:
> _“This document is relevant with 82% ± 4% confidence.”_
### ✔ **Performs intelligent abstention**
If HPVD is unsure, it says:
> _“No confident result found.”_  
> This prevents dangerous wrong retrievals—especially in RAG.
### ✔ **Shows exactly why each document was retrieved**
Users and auditors can view:
*   probabilistic logs
*   evidence lineage
*   confidence visualizations
*   sparse vs dense contributions
These features support **EU AI Act, GDPR, and enterprise compliance**. Hybrid Probabilistic Vector Dat…

## **How does the workflow look (simplified)?**
1. **Receive a query**
2. (text, metadata, speech transcript, etc.)
3. **Search both sparse and dense indexes**
    *   BM25/SPLADE for keyword matching
    *   ANN + transformer embeddings for semantic matching
4. **Calibrate the scores**
5. Align and convert them into a **single probabilistic scale**.
6. **Fuse the calibrated signals**
7. Compute a final, trustworthy relevance probability.
8. **Apply confidence rules**
    *   return results with confidence intervals
    *   abstain if uncertainty is too high
9. **Provide explanations**
10. Users can see why each item was retrieved and how confident the system was.

## **Who needs HPVD?**
### **RAG Systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
*   Prevents hallucinations from bad retrieval
*   Ensures only high-confidence evidence reaches LLMs
*   Enables auditable, enterprise-grade generative AI
### **Enterprise Search & CRM**
*   Customer support knowledge bases
*   Ticket retrieval
*   FAQ and product documentation search
### **Healthcare**
*   Retrieving patient records and clinical evidence with calibrated safety
### **Finance**
*   Regulatory document retrieval
*   Audit traceability
### **Legaltech**
*   Clause and case retrieval with explainability
*   Flagging ambiguous queries for human review

## **Why is HPVD important?**
HPVD shifts retrieval from “best guess” to **measured, transparent, and auditable** evidence selection.
It represents:
*   **Safer search** for high-risk industries
*   **Trustworthy RAG** for enterprises
*   **Compliance-ready retrieval** aligned with EU regulations
*   **A sovereign, auditable alternative** to opaque vector databases and LLM-based retrievers
By making retrieval **probabilistic rather than heuristic**, HPVD sets a new standard for trustworthy AI systems.
